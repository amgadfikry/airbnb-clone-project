# Airbnb Clone Project

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals

1. **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
2. **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.  
3. **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.  
4. **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.  

## Features Overview

### 1. API Documentation

- **OpenAPI Standard**: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
- **GraphQL**: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.  

### 2. User Authentication

- **Endpoints**: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
- **Features**: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### 3. Property Management  

- **Endpoints**: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
- **Features**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System

- **Endpoints**: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/  
- **Features**: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### 5. Payment Processing

- **Endpoints**: /payments/
- **Features**: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.  

### 6. Review System

- **Endpoints**: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
- **Features**: Post and manage reviews for properties.

### 7. Database Optimizations

- **Indexing**: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- **Caching**: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.  

## Technology Stack

- **Django**:  
Serves as the main backend framework, handling the server-side logic, models, views, authentication, and routing to power the core features like user management, property listings, bookings, and payments.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**:  
Extends Django’s capabilities by providing powerful tools to easily build, document, and manage RESTful APIs, making data exchange between the frontend and backend seamless.

- **PostgreSQL**:  
Acts as the primary database to securely store and manage structured data for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews with high reliability and scalability.

- **GraphQL**:  
Provides a more efficient and flexible way to fetch or manipulate specific data by allowing clients to request exactly what they need from the backend, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

- **Celery**:  
Manages asynchronous tasks like sending confirmation emails, processing background booking updates, or handling payment workflows without blocking the main application processes.

- **Redis**:  
Used for caching frequently accessed data (like user sessions or popular listings) to improve response times and reduce database load, and also supports Celery as a message broker.

- **Docker**:  
Containerizes the application and its dependencies, ensuring a consistent environment across development, testing, and production, making deployments more reliable and scalable.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**:  
Automates the testing, building, and deployment process, helping the team deliver updates faster, catch bugs earlier, and maintain high code quality with every change.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**:  
Responsible for implementing the core backend logic, API endpoints, and integrations needed to power user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. They also design the app’s architecture, ensure the scalability of the backend, and implement essential business logic following best practices.

- **Database Administrator**:  
Manages the PostgreSQL database setup, optimization, and security to ensure efficient and reliable data storage for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. Responsibilities include performance tuning, backups, access control, indexing, and disaster recovery planning to keep the system stable and data safe.

- **DevOps Engineer**:
Oversees the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of backend services using Docker and CI/CD pipelines. They unify development and operations by automating code releases, ensuring quick iterations without compromising the stability and reliability of the system.

- **QA Engineer**:  
Evaluates backend functionality, API performance, security, and data integrity through thorough testing processes. They create test plans, protocols, and reports, ensuring that the core features like user management, property management, bookings, payments, and reviews meet quality standards and user expectations.
